Baby, I don´t know if you speak much Spanish
if you understand when I say "my love"
let´s eat without understanding each other
we just have to like each other
you want me to fall into temptations
look how it makes me
that accent you have
I don't understand much, but come
 
Dance, dance, dance with me
dance, dance and I follow you
stick with me, come, let you go
don't leave me without wanting to return
so dance, dance, dance with me
dance, dance,I follow you
kiss me just one time
so I have a reason to see you again
 
Honestly, let this flow, don´t keep thinking about it
we have all night so you can teach me
everything you feel
iIt smells to me like there is nothing innocent about you
how do I tell you that I don't want to talk about love?
If it's with you, I have to think better
take it easy, leave it like that, I want to stay here
stick with me, come to me, stick with me, come to me
 
Dance, dance, dance with me
dance, dance and I follow you
stick with me, come, let you go
don't leave me without wanting to return
so dance, dance, dance with me
dance, dance,I follow you
kiss me just one time
so I have a reason to see you again
 
I'm going to leave you my number
you only have to call when you miss me
then I come
baby, even if I´m far
the girl is from another city, but I run my flow
I was curious and a kiss stole me
we don't have to talk
if we understand each other with eyes
 
I don't understand much, but dance, dance, dance with me
dance, dance and I follow you
Stick, come, let go
don't leave me without wanting to return
stick with me, come, let you go
dance, dance,I follow you
kiss me just one time
so I have a reason to see you again
